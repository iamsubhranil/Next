TODO
====

1. Multiple imports from the same package in the same import statement
2. Easy function imports, so that functions do not have to be called by deferencing module
    name. One way this could be done is by a mix of compile time arity matching, and runtime 
    softcall call semantics for the imported function.
3. Closures, this is a big one
4. Platform independent path traversal by using a builtin class/package
5. Automatic fiber scheduler
6. Async I/O
